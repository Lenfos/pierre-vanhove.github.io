Learn2Switch

Learn2Switch is a Fiverr project where I played a key role in creating a game design document
for an educational game aimed at high school and university students. The game is set on the
planet Mars and features a unique blend of adventure and puzzle. My work included designing
the story, gameplay and puzzles, as well as suggesting names for the different locations in the
game.

What makes Learn2Switch particularly interesting is its non-violent orientation. Designed with
education in mind, the game encourages players to solve puzzles, explore captivating Martian
environments and interact with characters, without ever resorting to violence. This project is
a testament to my ability to create enriching and instructive gaming experiences while fostering
a safe and stimulating gaming environment.

Ultimately, Learn2Switch is much more than just a game. It is an engaging educational tool that
combines the fun of video gaming with learning, taking players on a fascinating adventure to Mars,
 while reinforcing essential problem-solving and creative thinking skills. I was delighted to
 contribute to this project and help create a memorable educational experience.
