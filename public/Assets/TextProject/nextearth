<h2 class="projectTextTitle">Next Earth</h2>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">As a freelancer via Fiverr, I had the opportunity to collaborate on the Next Earth project,
a visionary initiative exploring the frontiers of innovation. My role in this project was to
create a detailed specification document for their website and design a game design document for
their flagship activity. At the heart of the project is a Web 3.0-based platform, incorporating
elements such as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and crypto-currency. Its central concept is the
ability to buy virtual parcels of land on Earth using crypto-currencies, with each parcel having
a unique value based on its geographical location.</p>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">What sets Next Earth apart is the ability for plot owners to personalise their acquisitions by
creating and managing NFTs. This feature opens the door to unprecedented digital creativity,
transforming each parcel into a unique digital work of art. What's more, the project has spawned
an active economy around these virtual plots, enabling users to buy, sell and trade land,
creating a dynamic market.</p>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">Next Earth represents a captivating adventure into the world of Web 3.0, NFT and crypto-currency,
while offering an innovative and stimulating economic experience. Working on this project has been
an exceptional opportunity for me, and I've been delighted to contribute to its realisation.</p>
