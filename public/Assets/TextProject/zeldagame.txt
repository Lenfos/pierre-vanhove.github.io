<h2 class="projectTextTitle">Zelda Game</h2>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">As part of a group of four students, I actively contributed to the
development of a game in C# that was inspired by the style of the first Zelda. This collaboration was
carried out as part of my studies, where we set about creating a captivating game world. My role in the
team involved programming in C#, designing gameplay features and coordinating with group members to
ensure a seamless experience.</p>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">The game we created is notable for its homage to the famous first Zelda,
with elements of exploration, puzzle solving and engaging combat. Using C# as the main programming
language, I helped implement the game mechanics, interaction management and overall balancing to
deliver an immersive experience for players.</p>

<p class="ProjectTextParagraph">This project, developed as part of a team, represents a significant
milestone in my educational career. It demonstrates my ability to work effectively in a group, to use
C# to create complex game functionalities, and to contribute to the realisation of a concrete project
in the field of video game development.</p>
